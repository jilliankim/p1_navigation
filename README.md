### Project Description


This repo is the first project in Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning course.

For this project, I trained an agent to navigate and collect bananas. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. The goal of this agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while not collecting blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
